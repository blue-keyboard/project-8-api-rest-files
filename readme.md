# Jesterly - Meme Social Network Back-end

Jesterly is a social network, where you can register and post memes for everyone to see. Also you can make 'memelists' which are like 'curated collections' maybe about a topic in particular or whatever concept you feel like, where you can include memes from yourself or others. (Same concept as spotify playlists).

There are authentication restrictions to perform some actions, like deleting a meme, updating an user, etc. Some actions are for everyone, other can only be done by an specific user (deleting a meme that a user himslef uploaded) or an admin.
